## ðŸ–± Why this project ? 

European laws force websites to ask user consent to accept cookies. If you enable
the Firefox option to delete cookies every time you close the window, the cookies
pop-ups will annoy you at every browser restart. One solution is to block these pop-ups
with an ad blocker like uBlock Origin. However, some websites disable scrolling
on their page until you accept/refuse cookies. This extension re-enables
scrolling.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Get it ?

### âœ… Official release

The add-on is currently under acceptance from Mozilla team.

### ðŸ“¦ Pack the Extension and Install it Yourself

Run :

```bash
./pack.sh
```

Then, check the documentation of Firefox about how to install zip extensions.

## âš™ How it Works

The extension injects a simple script in every page to enable scrolling:

```javascript
var r = 'html,body{overflow:auto !important;}';
var s = document.createElement('style');
s.type = 'text/css';
s.appendChild(document.createTextNode(r));
document.body.appendChild(s);
void 0;
```
